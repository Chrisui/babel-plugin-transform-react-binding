# babel-plugin-transform-react-binding

Automatically memoize function binding in your react render methods.

## What?

So you want to bind (bind context OR partially apply args) functions in your React
render method? Psych! You're going to break the purity of your next components since
you're *recreating* those functions on *every* render call. To fix this you need to
do context binding elsewhere, pass extra redundant props to caller or muck about with
cumbersome boilerplate.

This plugin takes care of this for you.

Write your `func.bind(this, whatever, arg)` calls. Use `event => handler(some, args, event)`
freely. Just, stop worrying!

We will transparently bind and memoize these behind the scenes.

## Installation

```sh
$ npm install babel-plugin-transform-react-binding
```

## Usage

### Via `.babelrc` (Recommended)

**.babelrc**

```json
{
  "plugins": ["transform-react-binding"]
}
```

### Via CLI

```sh
$ babel --plugins transform-react-binding script.js
```

### Via Node API

```javascript
require("babel-core").transform("code", {
  plugins: ["babel-plugin-transform-react-binding"]
});



```

### Options

- `cacheLimit = 500` - number of entries to keep in memoize cache PER COMPONENT
- `memoizeModule = 'lru-cache'` - module exporting memoize implementation

## TODO

- [ ] Support arrow functions in render methods
- [ ] Support functional components
- [ ] Finalise decision on comp vs instance cache and sensible default limit
